# Home Service Robot Project

## Writeup

This project uses the Turtlebot Navigation package and the included examples. Included is a test_slam.sh script that can generate a map using SLAM via the gmapping package. test_navigation.sh enables navigation in rviz by using Set Navigation Goal and Set Pose options in rviz; this is backed by the turtlebot sim and amcl packages (included in turtlebot_navigation). Lastly, home_service.sh utilizes the same navigation packages used for test_navigation, plus two new packages, `add_markers` and `pick_objects`, written by me (and based off example code in the Udacity module, as well as [this rviz tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Markers%3A%20Basic%20Shapes#CA-ec360db7a27929a4bc2c02272b109ee0df9cd070_34)). `add_markers` provides two ROS services, `addMarkers` and `clearMarker`. The former accepts an `x,y` pose to display an rviz marker at, and the latter clears the marker. This is utilized by `pick_objects`, which displays a marker to represent the object the robot is picking up. `pick_objects` sets goal nodes and allows the `amcl` and `ros_navigation` packages to localize and navigate through the map. The map is generated by creating a top-down view of the gazebo map, provided in `my_robot/maps/map.pgm`, but a map generated by `test_slam.sh` via gmapping could also be used.
